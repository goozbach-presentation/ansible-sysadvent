# Ansible
## What is Ansible?
* Configuration management but so much more
* Deployment tool
* Continous integration tool
* Agentless -- Uses ssh (paramiko or openssh-client)
** Nothing to set up (well apart from ssh host keys

## Ansible Architecture
* inventory -- which systems are we managing
** Hosts
** dynamic host system
* Playbooks -- Set of "plays" to apply
** Plays -- Group of related "tasks"
** Tasks -- list of "modules" to run
** Modules -- The workhorses of the Ansible system

# Getting Started
## Setup and prereqs
* python-json
* ssh key auth configuration
* DNS/hosts file to make things easier

## Set up the hosts file
* Create an entry in the hosts file
* Create a group

## Ansible 'ping' module
* Run a ping.

# Ansible Ad-Hoc Mode
* Run ad-hoc tasks from the command line
** create a file from a template -- we'll talk syntax later

# Your first playbook
* Create a simple playbook to install a package -- `vim-enhanced`
